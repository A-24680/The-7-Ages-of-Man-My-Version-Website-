It is because of the brilliance of Shakespeare’s writing skill that he was often called England’s National Poet and was also nicknamed as the Bard of Avon.
                    He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon to a successful businessman on 23rd April in the year 1564. About the age of seven, William Shakespeare, along with other boys of his social class, started attending the Stratford Grammar School. His evident love for nature in his writings could be said to have been influenced by the fields and woods surrounding the Stratford Grammar School throughout his childhood. Warwickshire was an exciting place to live in as the writer then also engaged in hunting and trap small game activities. It was because of the river Avon that ran down through the town was what endowed Shakespeare with the title ‘Bard of Avon’. William Shakespeare’s career likely took off with his theatrical life in London, and by the year 1592, he is believed to have become very well known. By this time, Shakespeare had joined one of the famous theatre companies in the city. From the year 1594, Shakespeare was the leading member of the acting group for almost the entire rest of his career. By the year 1594, William Shakespeare had already produced at least six plays. In Shakespeare’s lifetime, two monarchs had ruled over England. The first monarch being Henry VIII and then later succeeding him Queen Elizabeth began her rule. Shakespeare’s work had caught both the monarchs’ attention, and this is what made him a well-known playwright.Shakespeare, throughout his life, created brilliant pieces of English literate containing timeless characters with universal human qualities and struggles that readers find relatable to date. It was around 1613 when Shakespeare retired from this acting profession and settled in Stratford where he went on writing many excellent plays.

The sixth age shifts<br> Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,<br> With spectacles on nose and pouch on side; <br>His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide <br>For his shrunk shank;<br> and his big manly voice,<br> Turning again toward childish treble, pipes <br>And whistles in his sound. <br>Last scene of all, <br>That ends this strange eventful history, <br>Is second childishness and mere oblivion, Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.</q></i>

                    The poet compares the world to a stage in a theater and men and women to players. Each player has his/her exit and entrance. Similarly, men and women enter the world on birth and exit from it on death. They come to this stage, play their different roles and bid good-bye. These parts, acts or stages are normally seven.<br><br><br>

                    The birth of a child is the first act of the drama of human life. The human baby cries and vomits in the nurse’s arms. Soon he starts going to school. He has a shining face and carries a bag of books. He goes to school unwillingly, creeping like a snail. This is the second act of his life. The third role that he plays is of a lover. The young lover sighs like a furnace and sings some mournful songs praising the beauty of his beloved.<br><br><br>

                    The fourth stage is that of a soldier. He sports a beard like that of a leopard. He is quick-tempered in matters of honor. He seeks reputation even at the risk of his life. He is not afraid of death and danger while fighting for reputation. However, his reputation is short-lived. It is hollow like a bubble.<br><br><br>

                    Then comes the middle age. The fifth stage is that of a judge. He is fat with a round and fleshy stomach. He has a beard of formal cut. His eyes are now harsh-looking. He becomes strict in his behavior. He uses many sayings and modern instances to support his arguments of wisdom.<br><br><br>

                    The sixth age takes a person to old age. Man becomes weak in health and thin in body. He wears slippers, spectacles and clothes of his youth. These clothes are now too loose for his shrunk and thin legs. His voice becomes unmanly. He pipes and whistles. He lisps like a child as he is toothless. He looks a comic figure.<br><br><br>

                    The last role is that of an extremely old person. This ‘act’ shows him as helpless as a baby. He is toothless, hard of hearing, weak in eyesight and forgetful. In fact he loses control over all his senses. He departs from this world after playing these roles of life.<br>

                    The poem 'Seven Ages of Man'is a poetic endeavor to understand the deep philosophical truth that deeply informs the central idea of this poem – the rather stoic stance that right from our entry to exit on this stage of life, a man’s mortal bearings have been pre-determined by the universal creator by means of seven neat division or ‘Acts’ that define our worldly duration. This explanation seeks to ask some critical questions about free will or the lack of thereof, and the guiding force of destiny that reduces us all to mere actors who are but following a script in our pursuit to add meaning to life. <br><br> Thus, to deepen my knowledge on the world and to reflect on myself and do some some self-introspection, I wanted to write my own version and share it with my class <span>&#128515;</span>

                        A childhood full of faking internet issues, hoping to be believed.<br><br>

                        Documenting their life on a screen.<br><br>

                        Then, the young adult – so lost in life,<br>
                        Trying to break the stereotypes enforced by society<br><br>
                        Fitting in is a problem when you are 1 in a million.<br>
                        Avoiding the normalized evils of today…<br> <br>

                        And then the entrepreneur, hoping to succeed,<br>
                        Designing solutions to suit everyone’s needs.<br>
                        Their world revolving around their innumerable screations, <br>
                        Beating inflation becoming their new ambition.<br> <br>

                        Then comes the ponderer,<br>
                        Realizing, introspecting and reflecting, <br>
                        On how their ambitions created complex problems that needed solving.<br>
                        Climate change, depletion of resources and the end game,<br>
                        To all of which, a solution they themselves could not find.<br> <br>

                        Last scene of all,<br>
                        That ends this strange eventful history,<br>
